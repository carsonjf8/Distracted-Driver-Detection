Within this directory are thre python notebook files "efficientnet-
implementation.ipynb", "custom-cnn.ipynb", and "transfer-learning". The first file uses our OpenPose modfied datasets while the
second and third uses our baseline dataset. Links to our datasets which are being hosted on kaggle can
be found below. Please modify the paths for the datasets to load in the appropriate training or
testing datasets to math their paths in your directory. You will also have to move the test
directory in all of the modified datasets linked below to another directory this is to prevent
tfds from loading in the test directory as a class. and also allows you to load in the test
directory as another tfds for testing and predictions.

There is also a final report called "Measuring the Effects of Applying OpenPose to Distracted Driver Detection"
